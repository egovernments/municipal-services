### API Details

`BasePath` /ws-calculator/[API endpoint]

##### Method

a) `/meterConnection/_create`
   - Water Service created by calling the APIs in WS-Service. Once the Application activated for metered-connection, employee can add meter reading details using this API - ws-calculator/meterConnection/_create which in-turn will generate the Demand.
   - For the Non-Metered connections, the scheduler APIs need to be called periodically to generate the demand.

b) `/meterConnection/_search`
   - For the Metered Connection service, to get the previous meter reading ws-calculator/meterConnection/_search API used.

c) `/waterCalculator/_estimate`
   - To Activate the Water Service application, the user needs to pay the ONE_TIME_FEE for the connection. To calculate the ONE_TIME_FEE ws-calculator/waterCalculator/_estimate API used.

d) `/waterCalculator/_calculate`
